Simulates a few R1rho points with very long decays (N=500 delays)
The evolution of states A,B,C in 3D can be visualized.

To generate decays, run:
bm -sim BMNS-SimParams.txt 3DVecs/

To plot decays, select a csv file from the magVecs/ folder and run:
bm -3d [Magnetization CSV file]

E.g.
bm -3d 3DVecs/MagVecs/-750.0_400.0.csv
