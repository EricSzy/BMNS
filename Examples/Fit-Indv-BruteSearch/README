Iterates over pB in log space from 1e-3 to 1e-0 in 8 log increments
- pB$ 0.05 1e-3 1e-0 8
Iterates over kexAB in linear space from 1 to 8 in 1ppm linear increments
- dwB@ 3.0 1 8 8

This is 8*8 combinations.

Finds combination of pB and dwB with lowest red. chi-2 and begins a fit
from there to minimize all free parameters from there.
