Iterates over pB in log space from 1e-6 to 1e-1 in 6 log increments
- pB$ 0.05 1e-6 1e-1 6
Iterates over kexAB in linear space from 1 to 10 in 1ppm increments
- dwB@ 3.0 1 10 10

This is 10*6 combinations.

Finds combination of pB and dwB with lowest red. chi-2 and begins a fit
from there to minimize all free parameters from there.
