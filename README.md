# Bloch-McConnell 2-/3-state Fitting and Simulation Program

## Introduction
This program is designed to fit and simulate experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) rotating frame relaxation-dispersion (R1 rho) data by solving the Bloch-McConnell partial differential equations describing chemical exchange in an external magnetic field using eigenvalue decomposition. 

## Installation of BMNS in a Conda environment
It is recommended that you use an Anaconda environment to run BMNS.
The *conda_bmns.sh* bash script will install the required Python
dependencies.

```bash
      bash conda_bmns.sh bmns
      source activate bmns
```
