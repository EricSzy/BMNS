# Bloch-McConnell 2-/3-state Fitting and Simulation Program

## Introduction
This program is designed to fit and simulate experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) rotating frame relaxation-dispersion (R1 rho) data by solving the Bloch-McConnell partial differential equations describing chemical exchange in an external magnetic field using eigenvalue decomposition.
